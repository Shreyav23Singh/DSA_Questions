Inheritance  : - Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs 
(Object Oriented programming system).

==>  The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods
     and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
     
     
 ==>   Why use inheritance in java  <===
1.  For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
2.  For Code Reusability.
     
     
#  Example 1 #

class Shape{
  String Color ;
  
  
}
class Triangle extends Shape{
  //System.out.println("Hi , I am Triangle  and mys color is : ");
}
public class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Triangle t1=new Triangle();
    t1.Color="Red";
    System.out.println("Hi , I am Triangle  and my color is : "+t1.Color );
  }
}
