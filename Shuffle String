1528. Shuffle String

Q. You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] 
in the shuffled string.

Return the shuffled string.


|**    Example 1:   **
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.

**    Example 2:   **

Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.

Solution - Brute Force Approach
class Solution {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
      String ans="";  //Blank String to store answer
      int a=0;
      for(int i=0;i<indices.length;i++){
          
          if(a<indices.length){
              if(a==indices[i]){  
              ans+=s.charAt(i);  // ans = ans + s.charAt(i) ;
              a++;         
              i=-1;
              }
          }
      }
      return ans;
    

        
    }
}
